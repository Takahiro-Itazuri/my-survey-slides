    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    In this paper, we present the mQA model, which is able to answer questions about the content of an image. The answer can be a sentence, a phrase or a single word. Our model contains four components: a LSTM to extract the question representation, a CNN to extract the visual representation, an LSTM for storing the linguistic context in an answer, and a fusing component to combine the information from the first three componenets and generate the answer. We construct a Freestyle Multilingual Image Question Answering (FM-IQA) dataset using MS-COCO to train and evaluate our mQA model. The quality of the generated answers of our mQA model on this dataset is evaluated by human judges through a Turing Test. The dataset contains 158,392 images and 316,193 questions.<br>
