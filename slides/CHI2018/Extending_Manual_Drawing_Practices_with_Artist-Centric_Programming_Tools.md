    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    Our research question is "How can we develop programming environments thta support the integration of procedural and manual art?" We created Dynamic Brushes, a visual programming and drawing environment for blending manual and procedural production through personal tool creation.<br>
    <u><b>Contribution</b></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>We introduce Dynamic Brushes, an integrated visual programming and stylus-based drawing environment.</li>
      <li>We demonstrate the Dynamic Brushes programming model, which enables the creation of numerous tool behaviors through a small number of primitives and operations.</li>
      <li>We demonstrate how procedural tool creation can extend manual practices, support reflection, and foster agency through an extended evaluation with professional artists.</li>
      <li>We provide insights for developing learnable and expressive procedural tools that are compatible with manual creation.</li>
