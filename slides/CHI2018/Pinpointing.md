    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    It is important to design interaction techniques that allow precise selection and manipulation of virtual objects, without bulky input devices. This paper explores Pinpointing: multimodal head and eye gaze pointing techniques for wearable AR. A comparison of speed and poiting accuracy reveals the relative merits of each method, including the achievable target size for robust selection. We demonstrate and discuss example applications for augmented reality, including compact menus wth deep structure, and a proof-of-concept method for on-line correction of calibration drift.<br>
    <u><b>Contribution</b></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>A broad comparison of target selection accuracy and speed for eye gaze, head pointing, and several multimodal techniques for improved accuracy.</li>
      <li>Adoption of multimodal techniques for wearable AR, resulting in several previously unexplored implementations that refine coarse eye gaze and head pointing with fine hand gesture, device gyro and head motion input.</li>
      <li>Two example applications that demonstrate the potential of Pinpointing for improving wearable AR interaction: GazeBrowser uses gaze interaction with high precision pointing to navigate compact smart object menus. SmartPupil shows a novel online method for mitigating calibration drift of wearable eye trackers.</li>
