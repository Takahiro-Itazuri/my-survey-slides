    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    Wikipedia has likely become one of the most important datasets and research environments in modern computing. However, the extensive Wikipedia literature has largely considered Wikipedia in isolation, outside of the context of its broader Internet ecosystem. This paper examines Wikipedia's relationships with two large-scale online communities: Stack Overflow and Reddit. This paper asks two overarching research questions. <i>RQ1: What value is Wikipedia providing to other large-scale online communities? RQ2: What value do these large-scale online communities provide to Wikipedia</i> For Wikipedia and its editors, RQ1's results further demonstrate the critical role the Wikipedia Community plays in the broader online ecosystem outside of Wikipedia. However, our RQ2 results present more challenging implications for the Wikipedia community: these results highlight the need for further research on soltuions to the paradox of re-use.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>This paper examines Wikipedia's relationships with large-scale online communities.</li>
      <li>We find evidence of consequential, albeit unidirectional relationships. Wikipedia provides substantial value to both comunities, with Wikipedia content increasing visitation, engagement, and revenue, but we find little evidence that these websites contribute to Wikipedia in return.</li>
      <li>Overall, these findings highlight important connections between Wikipedia and its broader ecosystem that should be considered by researchers studying Wikipedia.</li>
      <li>Critically, our results also emphasize the key role that volunteer-created Wikipedia content plays in improving other websites, even contributing to revenue generation.</li>
