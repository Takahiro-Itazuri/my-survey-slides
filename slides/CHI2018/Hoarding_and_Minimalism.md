    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
     We focused on a main, broad research question: how do people approach digital data preservation in the cloud age? How do they decide what to keep and discard? We interviewed 23 participants with diverse backgrounds, asking them about their perceived digital data. I an interative analysis process, we uncovered a spectrum of tendencies that drive preservation strategies, with two extremes: hoarding (where participants accumulated large amounts of data, even if considered of little value) and minimalism (where they kept as little as possible, regularly clearning their data). We contrast and compare the two extremes of the spectrum, characterize their nuanced nature, and discuss how our categorization compares to previously reported behaviors. We conclude with broad implications for shaping technology.<br>
