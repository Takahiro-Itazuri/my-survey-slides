    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    Research that empirically examines the social and interactional issues of Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) in everyday use is lacking. Our study documents the methodical practices of VUI users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. We discuss how the VUI is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. Finally, we locate implications for the accountability of VUI interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the motion of designing 'conversational' interfaces.<br>
    <u><b>Contribution</b></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>The analysis presented here explicates how VUI use is routinely accounted for and embedded in talk-in-interaction.</li>
      <li>We turned to transferring our findings from that of matters of interaction to conceptual discussion points, to inform and shape future research and design on the use of VUIs.</li>
