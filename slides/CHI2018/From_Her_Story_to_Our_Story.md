    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    This research explores the potential for abortion storytelling platforms to effectively raise awareness and promote public engagement around abortion rights advocacy in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Within this paper, we define advocacy as any attempt to raise awareness and shift perceptions of abortion - not only in the political sphere, but also in the private and public spheres. This research addresses a current dearth in HCI for Reproductive Rights and responded to calls for activist design that simulates critical conversations around contested issues. We point to desig opportunities for digital storytelling to be effectively curated as an advocacy tool. Specifically, we present opportunities to: raise awareenss and challenge stigma through the exposing of hidden realities; foster empathy and polyvocality as a means of expanding the collective community; and provide stepping stone to activism that allow for engagement at different levels. In doing so, we respond to calls for further-understanding of how digital storytelling might be used beyond catharsis, and contribute insight into a gap in knowledge about the role online engagement plays in effecting tangible change.<br>
