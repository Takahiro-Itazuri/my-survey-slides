    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    The research aim was to study how to design gamiied applications that make safe driving more engaging. To address this research aim, we present a user study, our interative design process, and two prototype evaluations. We discussed how the six design lenses data, presentation, time, interface, social context and road conditions are useful to bring into focus user needs and contextual requirements throughout the entire design process.<br>
    <u><b>Contribution</b></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>We offer six lenses through which to view the design of gamified driving applications.</li>
      <li>We present new empirical data from a user study and ten design recommendations derived from it.</li>
      <li>Through two prototype evaluations, we show how these lenses and recommendations can help to implement concrete applications that successfully increase task engagement.</li>
