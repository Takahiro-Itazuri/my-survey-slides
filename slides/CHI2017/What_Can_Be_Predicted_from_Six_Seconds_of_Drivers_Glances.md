    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    We consider a large dataset of real-world, on-road driving from a 100-car naturalistic study to explore the predictive power of driver glances and, specifically, to answer the following question: what can be predicted about the state of the driver and the state of the driving environment from a 6-second sequence of macro-glances?<br>
    <u><b>Contribution</b></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Just 6 seconds of coarse driver gaze regions can be used to predict a lot of things about the driver, the car, and the driving environment.</li>
      <li>Drive gaze has been used to predict attention allocation, but not to predict everything else. We try to just that for the first time and show when it works and when it doesn't.</li>
