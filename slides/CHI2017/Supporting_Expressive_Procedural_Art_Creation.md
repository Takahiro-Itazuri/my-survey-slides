    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    Contrasting the creative opportunities of procedural art with the challenges of programming raises our research question: <i>Can we support accessible and expressive procedural art by enabling people to describe procedural relationships through direct manipulation?</i> Our approach is to augment the conventions of graphic art software to support the creation and modification of procedural relationships exclusively through manipulation of concrete artwork. We developed Para, a digital illustration tool that supports the creation of declarative constraints in vector artwork.<br>
    <u><b>Contribution</b></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>We introduce Para, a new direct-manipulation tool that supports procedural art through live, non-linerar, and continuous manipulation.</li>
      <li>We demonstrate core declarative procedural operations that can be expressed through direct manipulation, are easy to use, and enable diverse creative outcomes.</li>
      <li>We provide evidence for how the direct manipulation of procedural relationships can extend manual practice through two open-ended studies.</li>
      <li>We provide recommendations for building expressive direct manipulation procedural tools, as gleaned from evaluation.</li>
