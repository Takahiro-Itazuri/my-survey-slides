    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    We present a qualitative study of the digital privacy and security motivations, practices, and challenges of a specific population facing higher levels of risk in their daily lives: survivors of intimate partner abuse (IPA). Our research questions are "What role has digital provacy and security played in the experiences that survivors of IPA have with their abusers?", "What are IPA survivors' motivations, practices, and challenges when protecting their privacy and security online and on their devices?", and "What technology design implications do the digital privacy and security challenges faced by survivors of IPA suggest?" Results of our study were used to develop a framework organizing suvivor technology practices and challenges into three-phases of intimate partner abuse: physical control, escape, and life apart.<br>
    <u><b>Contribution</b></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>a three-phase framework for organizing suvivors' techonology practices and challenges. This framework provides rmpirically sound, foundational guidance for technology creators to consier how new and existing technologies may be designed to help survivors of IPA.</li>
