    <u><b>Abstract</b></u><br>
    We examine the research question: <i>How do ICTs affect political engagement and interactions with city officials around crime prevention in diverse neighbothoods?</i> In this paper, we describe how citizens use ICTs to influence local policy, particularly amoung law enforcement and local government officials.<br>
    <u><b>Contribution</b></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Our findings provide insignts into the usage of ICTs to support local governance for crime prevention, extending prior HCI research focused on the use of technology to support local engagement.</li>
      <li>Our results add to the conversation that technology alone cannot equitably empower citizens to solve deep-seated social problems such as crime without addressing the underlying inequities across communities.</li>
      <li>Our study builds on prior work in HCI that provides insights into designing for traditionally marginalized groups.</li>
